2. You can open the project in any compatible IDE.
3. Connect your device or emulator to your computer.
4. In your IDE, run the `flutter run` command.


## Code Overview
1. For the sake of neatness, the project consists of different files.
2. MyStatelessWidget.dart includes the key components of most of the textfields of the project as a stateless widget.
3. MyStatefulWidget.dart file is where the code for the responsive 'TAP ME' button and incrementing number.
4. Mainpage.dart file is where all the components of my code work as a dummy project.
